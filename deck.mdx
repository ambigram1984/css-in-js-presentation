# CSS in JS

## Demonstrated with Emotion 👩‍🎤

agenda 🗓️

- Why CSS in JS?
- Examples with Emotion

<Invert>No, really? Y tho?</Invert>

In my opinion, CSS in JS is an alternative to pre-processors. We are still leveraging out exsisting knowledge of CSS;
however we now have different ways of managing/maintaining the code produces our css, in addition to new capabilities that
are not possible with SASS

---

drawbacks of css-in-js 😬

- More tools to learn and manage
  - Not the old way.
    - Retort: SASS was new once upon a time.
  - Some designers also write css, which now introduces a knowledge of javascript.
    - Retort: The jump in syntax is not that huge if a developer is used to writing SASS.
      The larger issue here would be project structure, which is something a team should already
      be collaborating on.

---

drawbacks of css-in-js

- Have to ship the run time.
  - Takes a performance hit.
  - Unless your using a library that supports but that has other issues.
  - Retort: The existing libraries are already being used in production by large companies. This
    performance impact is most likely minimal and must be measured against the benefit of getting
    better static analysis.
- Committing to a library
  - Material-UI uses JSS 💩(lol j/k; it's just not for me.)
- Loose the cascade
  - Retort: This is also a pro of using CSS-in-JS.

benefits 🤘

> What can we do with CSS-in-JS that we can’t do with SASS/CSS Modules?

- Capable of static analysis.
- Run time style generation/manipulation.
- Javascript >= Sass.
- Everything in the same file.

---

capable of static analysis 🔎

- Type enforcement
  - We can assert on the validity of CSS properties without additional tooling.
- Critical CSS
  - Only styles required to render the component are loaded for any page without additional configuration.
- Server Rendering
  - Frameworks like Next.js can render only the required styles on the server.
- Dead code elimination
  - Styles that are un-used can be identified and removed from the bundle.

---

run time style generation/manipulation 🏃

- Previously we could only manipulate styles at build time.
  - Example: Imagine generating a grid.
- We no longer use classnames, just style objects or components.
  - No more name collisons
  - No more cascade
  - Global library style support is 👌in emotion.

---

javascript >= sass 🛠️

- JS can do everything SASS can do.
- No need to learn extra concepts in SASS (functions, constants, spread operators, and even utility functions)
  - This gives us more elaborate ways to compose styles and generate utilities for re-using styles

---

a lesson from vue.js 🔭

<Split>

- I remember thinking React was dumb because it mixed HTML/JS 🤓
- Including styles in the same file was originally pioneered by Vue.js (I think lol)
- Code is more readable as we do not have to navigate multiple files to tell what is going on

<img src={VueComponentImage} width="65%" alt="Example of vue code" />

</Split>

<Notes>- Working with Backbone.js required three files to be open.</Notes>

---

everything in same file 📝

<Split>

- From looking at the component we can see styles and not class properties.
- We know these styles are only d to this file.
- We can see how props affect properties intsead of manipulating class names.

# Questions 🙋

<Notes>
  - Differences from inline styling - Have to implement work arounds for things
  like pseudo selectors and media queries - Loss of global styles - Styles are
  in dom, which make dev tools super hard to readable - Rendering performance
  takes a hit because each node's style tag has to be evaluated
</Notes>
